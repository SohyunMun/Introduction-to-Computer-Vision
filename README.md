KNN Assignment
- Use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset with a train/test split only.
- Use KNN with a train/validation/test split, using the validation set to select hyperparameters (e.g., the value of k).
- Perform 5-fold cross-validation.
- Compute and report the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Plot the 5-fold cross-validation performance as a function of k (e.g., accuracy vs. k; include error bars if possible).
